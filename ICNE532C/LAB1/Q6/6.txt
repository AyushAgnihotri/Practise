Ans:
	TCP : The absolute limitation -> 64K (65535 bytes).
	TCP deals with segments instead of packets.
	Each TCP segment has a sequence number which is contained inside a TCP header.
	The actual data sent in a TCP segment is variable.
	However it can be calculated by function "tcp_maxseg" function in socket.h .
	UDP : The correct maximum UDP message size is 65507 bytes, as determined by the
	following formula:
	0xffff - (sizeof(IP Header) + sizeof(UDP Header)) = 65535-(20+8) = 65507
